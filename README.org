* SICP homeworks

This is only an useless and boring repository to record my solutions of SICP.

As a proof that I'm still alive on this world and indeed spending time learning something.

Life is short.

** Info
1. Use Guile (R6RS) as platform.
2. I've understand Emacs Lisp before reading SICP, so my solutions may contains some elements that exceed the range of the chapter have taught.
3. I may not find answer after solving questions, if I have no interest on it. This homework is just for fun (may be along with training my stupid brain). So my solution may contains mistakes.
